Program purpose: this is a prototype of a mobile app that ensures people’s safety by relying on other available users’ help. this prototype involves a UI design through figma and back-end code on C++ with partial swift (mobile app) code.

Why sun after dark?

Looking at other apps on the market that serve people in urgent situations (such as Noonlight), we realize there are several problems that may incur unintentionally. One is the emphasis on shying away from false alarms, which sometimes may just be a person thinking they are in danger but fortunately they are not, and they may end up with a bill in their mail box. two is, though there are terrible things happening every day that may involve dialing 911, not every uncomfortable situation may result in the need of a dispatcher. 

This app that we develop does not claim to replace other apps that ensure users’s safety, but we wish to help people, mainly targeting womxn identifying groups, in avoiding situations that they may not wish to handle alone.

Here comes Sun After Dark, an app that allows users to send help requests pre-event to make sure they feel safe going into those events. Such events may be, grabbing dinner with an ex with abusive tendencies, living in a hotel room alone in an unfamiliar area, having worsening flu/covid that may deteriorate one’s capability to dial for urgent care. The help requests would be delivered as notifications to other users in the vicinity who have previously stated are free during that time, and those other users who accept the request would take on as verifiers who fulfill the request. a request can be small, such as making sure to text at a certain time to make sure things are going okay, or can escalate to dialing urgent care for a sick patient. the verifier would not have access to the requestee’s information, as everything would be hashed. when dialing and giving location on behalf of the requestee, a built in gps system using the gps api would be delivered to 911 or urgent care. however, the requestee’s customizable information may be released to their verifier, such as their blood type or whether they are on insurance. delivering those information may be useful. throughout this process, the requestee’s name may not be revealed to protect their privacy. 

Sun After Dark would first be released among college campuses, and campus police may be replaced by 911 in desperate situations.

Who would use sun after dark?

Those people who may feel that they have no close relations in the city, in the same country, or even the same time zone. Without an immediate emergency contact, they may rely on others in the community to serve as an emergency contact for them, providing that no further information would be disclosed to the verifier (which is where hashing and encryption of personal information plays an important role). 

Users may be given the option to add other users on the app, perhaps due to the convenience in location and time compatibility and they may choose to establish long term verifyee-verifier mutual relations between them.

How does sun after dark protect user safety?

Requestee/verifyee’s real name and real time location would not be disclosed to any user. potential verifiers, before accepting the request, may only see a false name, the details of the request, gender identity of the requestee, and their approximate distance between. 

Based on previous trails and case studies including Noonglight, we believe that by starting with introducing it to college campuses, to people who already feel that they belong to a pre-existing community, this idea would run well and eventually garner enough support to discuss a partnership with the local police. 

During the sign up phase for new users, the user would have to provide a photo identification and passport image in order to be verified to avoid ill-intentioned users. when sending messages and dialing phone calls, numbers would be hashed.
